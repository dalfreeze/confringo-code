<option value=" Unicorn hair generally produces the most consistent magic, and is least subject to fluctuations and blockages.
    Wands with unicorn cores are generally the most difficult to turn to the Dark Arts. They are the most faithful
    of all wands, and usually remain strongly attached to their first owner, irrespective of whether he or she was
    an accomplished witch or wizard. Minor disadvantages of unicorn hair are that they do not make the most powerful
    wands (although the wand wood may compensate) and that they are prone to melancholy if seriously mishandled,
    meaning that the hair may 'die' and need replacing.">Unicorn Tail Hair</option>
<option value=" As a rule, dragon heartstrings produce wands with the most power, and which are capable of the most flamboyant
    spells. Dragon wands tend to learn more quickly than other types. While they can change allegiance if won from
    their original master, they always bond strongly with the current owner. The dragon wand tends to be easiest to
    turn to the Dark Arts, though it will not incline that way of its own accord. It is also the most prone of the
    three cores to accidents, being somewhat temperamental.">Dragon Heartstring</option>
<option
    value=" The frugal counterpart to dragon heartstring, Dragon Tear cores lead to a wand that weeps crimson liquid at random. It too has a tendency to become rather melancholy resulting in half-hearted spells and thus it is highly advised the owner maintains a sunny disposition to help counteract the wand’s mood.">
    Dragon Tear</option>
<option value=" This is the rarest core type. Phoenix feathers are capable of the greatest range of magic, though they may take
    longer than either unicorn or dragon cores to reveal this. They show the most initiative, sometimes acting of
    their own accord, a quality that many witches and wizards dislike. Phoenix feather wands are always the pickiest
    when it comes to potential owners, for the creature from which they
    are taken is one of the most independent and detached in the world. These wands are the hardest to tame and to
    personalise, and their allegiance is usually hard won.">Phoenix Feather</option>
<option value=" If you're thinking about having a wand made with Acromantula web, you're probably a fan of having your wand
    confiscated by the authorities. Using a wand with this core has been illegal in Britain since 1782, after it was
    discovered that the wielder of an Acromantula web wand has particular ability with Dark magics, especially the
    Imperius curse. There are certain diplomatic exceptions, as it is a traditional core for Asian wands, but even
    those are temporary, and many wizard diplomats on long-term assignments find themselves compelled to procure
    replacement wands for their stay.">Acromantula Web</option>
<option value=" Augureys, or Irish phoenixes, were once associated with powerful Dark wands, as their cries were thought to
    signify an upcoming death. However, they were in reality never a strong Dark core, and were more accurately a
    powerful core for Divinations. Misunderstood students may find themselves bonded to an augurey wand, although
    these wands are altogether quite rare.">Augurey Tail Feather</option>
<option value=" Basilisk wands are incredibly rare, as the beasts are rare to begin with and hard to kill. Due to the rarity,
    they often are passed down from generation to generation, so basilisk-core wands are either the heirloom of
    Slytherin-type Pureblood families or reforged wands from family cores. The occasional new basilisk wand will
    almost always bond to a Parselmouth or budding Dark Wizard. Very little good comes out of wielders of basilisk
    wands.">Basilisk Skin</option>
<option value=" Billywig stingers are not common in Britain, but are occasionally imported from Australia, the native habitat of
    the Billywig. Billywig wands bond almost exclusively to light-hearted pranksters, and are extremely capricious-
    at one moment it will produce the strongest Cheering Charm in the school, but another time it will object to
    being used as a potion stirrer and siphon up hours of work without so much as a by-your-leave. When they do bond
    to a witch or wizard, they tend to be of Hufflepuff or Gryffindor.">Billywig Stinger</option>
<option value=" Boomslang venom, whether crystallized or in a rarer liquid core, provides a small boost to jinxes and hexes
    thanks to its venomous qualities. However, when a wandmaker undertakes the dangerous task of working with the
    raw venom, it is generally with the aim of creating a powerful Transfiguration wand. Whether or not the
    advantages outweigh the risks is not generally agreed upon in wandmaking circles.">Boomslang Venom</option>
<option value=" Although chimera scales are magically powerful, they are extremely rare in modern wandcraft. This is not out of
    any concern for safety, as they are generally considered no more stubborn than hippogriff feathers, and are more
    stable than Erumpent hide. The fact of the matter is that there are more recorded basilisk slayings in the past
    fifty years than there are chimera slayings in all of recorded history. This one slaying occurred in Greece over
    two millenia ago, so what scales were harvested at that time have been degraded, broken, and dispersed. Today, they
    are only found as parts of heirloom cores, and even then, all such cores are a more common core (often dragon
    heartstring) with a tiny fragment of scale embedded. Chimera wands are most common in Greece and
    the Balkans, although as they were circulated through the Mediterranean and former Roman Empire they are found
    throughout Europe. These wands are prized for their raw power, although they are difficult to control.">Chimera
    Scale Fragment</option>
<option value=" Demiguise hairs were long considered to not have enough oomph to make a proper wand, but with the advent of
    multiple cores they have gained favor for their strength in Transfiguration and the subtle arts. When combined
    with a stronger wand core they make potent wands, however, on their own they can be rather one-dimensional and
    difficult to use for anything but Transfiguration. They have found favor in students of all Houses, although
    they may be slightly rarer among the open Hufflepuffs.">Demiguise Hair</option>
<option value=" Doxy wings, like the creatures they come from, can be unmanageable and mean-spirited. They are second only to
    basilisk wands in their abilities with the Dark Arts, and as such these rare wands are most often found in the
    hands of stubborn Slytherins without the familial connection to obtain a basilisk core.">Doxy Wing</option>
<option value=" There is a very good reason this is an exotic- Erumpent hide wands are extremely dangerous, and don't take well
    to high levels of magic or sharp impacts. They may add a 'punch' to spells when combined with a gentler core,
    but most wandmakers refuse to work with it completely due to the danger it poses to maker and wielder.">Erumpent
    Hide</option>
<option value=" This core makes for a light, airy wand, and is the absolute best for Charms. They also signify a connection to
    the mystic, so these wands, despite their relative rarity, are used by nearly half of known witches and wizards
    with the Sight. Despite their astounding strength in Charms, they are merely average in Defense Against the Dark
    Arts and Transfiguration, and will often fail at hexes altogether. As such, they’re not commonly found in
    Slytherin House, but are common in Hufflepuff. Ravenclaws and Gryffindors may be drawn to this core, although
    they tend to react better to blends of fairy wings and unicorn hair.">Fairy Wing</option>
<option value=" Fwooper feather wands are said to be a mark of ill omen for the wizards they bond to, as, like the birds they
    come from, they are rumored to slowly drive their wielder mad. Despite their poor reputation, they do well with
    Charms and Care of Magical Creatures. However, they have a near-inability to cast Quietus. They are commonly
    combined with another feather core, such as the phoenix for health or the hippogriff for stability.">Fwooper
    Feather</option>
<option value=" Hippogriffs are noble animals with a reputation for not taking a slight. These wands require constant respect,
    and if the wielder does not give it, they can watch its formerly stable and versatile magic backfire on it. It
    is not the strongest core, but it is one of the most adaptable. These wands are most common amongst Gryffindors,
    but they are rare overall.">Hippogriff Feather</option>
<option value=" The antler of a Jackalope is a wand core used by Ilvermorny founders James Steward and Isolt Sayre in the 17th
    century when they begun making their own wands.">Jackalope Antler</option>
<option value=" Kelpie hairs are incredibly tempermental cores, explaining their rarity. They were once common in Celtic
    wandmaking, however, the import of demiguise hairs has resulted in them falling out of favor. They have similar
    qualities to demiguise hair, and are powerful Transfiguration cores when they don't backfire spectacularly.">Kelpie
    Hair</option>
<option value=" The hair of the rougarou was used as a wand core by the American wandmaker Violetta Beauvais. Beauvais kept the
    fact that she used this particular wand core a secret for many years, but it was eventually revealed. Rougarou
    hair was believed to have an affinity for Dark magic, like vampires to blood.">Rougarou Hair</option>
<option value=" The tail feather of the Thunderbird was used as a wand core by the American wandmaker Shikoba Wolfe. Wolfe's
    wands were powerful but difficult to master, and were good for transfiguration work. Wands with Thunderbird tail
    feather cores, like the birds the feathers are taken from, are able to sense danger and can cast curses on their
    own.">Thunderbird Feather</option>
<option value=" Veela wands are temperamental like the creatures they come from, and are considered too volatile for a decent
    wand core in many circles. However, some wizards, particularly those with Veela blood, enjoy the boost it gives
    to outdoorsy magics, divinations, and Charms. The veela’s inherent intelligence makes finding these wands among
    the non-Veela blooded most common in Ravenclaw.">Veela Hair</option>
<option value=" Thestral wands generally produce strong magic but only when the wielder understands themselves. If the wielder
    does not know themselves or loses themselves than their spells will suffer. When the wielder knows themselves
    than this wand can create very strong spells. The thestral wands work very well for Charms, Defense Against the
    Dark Arts, and Transfiguration. The Thestral wands are very tempermental and rare to find with Wizards and
    Witches of today. The most common thestral hair wands are found with Ravenclaws and very rarely with
    Hufflepuffs.">Thestral Tail Hair</option>
<option value=" Vampire fang wands like the Chimera Fragment wands are very rare and mostly heirloom wands. A vampire fang core
    is mostly handed down from previous owners of such wands. Vampire fangs are a very versatile wand core and can
    be either Dark or Light. The vampire fang has no certain divinity and will choose what it’s owner chooses as it
    is a very loyal bond. This core works well with Charms, and Divinations. Often this wand is exceptional for
    potion stirring.">Vampire Fang</option>
<option value=" The hair of the Wampus cat was used as a wand core by the American wandmaker Johannes Jonker. Jonker experimented
    with many other cores before settling on the hair of this creature as his preferred kind. The core was also used
    by Isolt Sayre and James Steward when they begun making their own wands in the 17th century.">Wampus Hair</option>
<option value=" There are several different cores that can come from a werewolf which include whiskers, hair, saliva, and nails.
    All of these from a werewolf have their own virtues however they all make for an exceptional wand. Werewolf
    cores ally themselves with made werewolves and born werewolves very well. However they do often ally themselves
    with a strong owner, one who has courage, bravery, and loyalty. This wand is an extremely loyal wand and will
    cause many difficulties for anyone who tries to take the wand from their owner. It will often backfire on
    someone who has stolen or won the wand, it does not cooperate well with others. Overall the werewolf cores all
    do well with divinations and outdoorsy elements. Whiskers do well with Transfiguration.">Werewolf Whiskers</option>

<option value=" A spine taken from the back of a White River Monster, a magical fish native to the White River in Arkansas, was
    used as a wand core by the American wandmaker Thiago Quintana. Quintana's wands produced spells of force and
    elegance. Quintana's harvesting of White River Monster spines initially raised concerns of over-fishing, but
    because he was the only one who knew how to lure the creatures, the ecological impact was not severe. White
    River Monster spines were no longer used as a wand core after Quintana's death, as he took the secret of luring
    the creature to his grave.">White River Monster Spine</option>

    value=" There are two specific mermaid cores that are used in current day wand making but are heirloom cores again, scales being the more frugal of the two. The
    scales and hair from a mermaid are very strong magical conductors and often only given from family member to
    family member. It is very rare that I see this core in the modern times as it isn’t often mermaid families
    create new wands. This core is again very loyal to his wielder and very difficult to wield if taken or won.
    Though this wand can be very temperamental as it only likes to be held by wielders who are very knowledgeable
    but not greedy. If the wielder is neither than it is more likely that this wand will not be allied with them. If
    a wand is allied with a wielder who is neither than it will take time before the wand is strong but when it
    becomes close to its wielder than it will be very loyal, as well as strong. Overall the mermaid cores do well
    with outdoorsy elements and care of magical creatures. Mermaid Scales do well with Transfiguration, and singers will love a wand with Mermaid’s Scale as it lends a beautiful melody to the voice when used for amplification spells, however this core can also make for a very vain wand. Do not compliment any other wands in its presence, or humans, or animals, or jewelry. In fact it’s best their owner hates everything, less they find themselves drowned in a puddle.">

In fact it will often cast this spell regardless of what it’s owner intended to cast and as a pleasant surprise one often finds interesting bits and doo-dads on their person.
