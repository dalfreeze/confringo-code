<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Surprisingly swishy. A wand with this flexibility will either surprise its owner by being surprisingly loyal or surprisingly unloyal and
    is most often known for doing the unexpected. It is usually great for charm work. Owners that are matched with wands
    of this flexibility are usually the type of people who have a hard time coming out of their shell or opening up, but
    once they do, others will find themselves drawn to their charming, fun-loving personalities. The owner usually
    adapts well to unexpected changes but may find it difficult to make hard decisions.">Surprisingly swishy</option>

<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Swishy. A wand with this flexibility may not be too loyal to its owner and may switch loyalties at a moment’s notice. It is
    particularly good at charms. Owners that are matched with wands of this flexibility may be very sociable and
    fun-loving with a penchant for some mischief-making. They are usually very clever and prefer not to tie themselves
    down to any particular way of thinking until they’ve gathered all that they need to know.">Swishy</option>

<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Slightly springy. A wand with this flexibility may not appear to be very loyal at all because they will initially take to new owners
    quite well, but the fact of the matter is that they will always have a special tie to their original owner. As time
    goes on, this wand will become increasingly more troublesome for any owner that isn’t its original owner until
    finally it stops working altogether. This wand is good for crafting spells. Owners matched with this wand may be
    very cheerful and optimistic, but most of all, they have very big (and possibly overactive) imaginations. Their
    thought patterns tend to be outside of the box.">Slightly springy</option>

<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Fairly bendy. A wand with this flexibility tends to be very loyal to its original owner; if it finds itself in a new owner’s hands,
    it will make itself difficult to work with, but with time, it will eventually warm up to a new owner. This wand is
    not exceptional at any particular branch of magic but is well-rounded enough that it will do well or average in
    every area. Owners of a fairly bendy wand are well-liked but pride themselves on trying to stand out from the crowd.
    Unfortunately, some of them may be quite susceptible to peer pressure, usually brought on by being in a group
    considered “different” from others.">Fairly bendy</option>

<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Very flexible. A wand with this flexibility is happy in anyone’s hands, but this disadvantage is somewhat off-set by the fact that
    this wand does exceptionally well in just about every area of magic. Owners of this wand flexibility come with a
    very wide variety of personalities, but they do share a very high level of adaptability to just about any situation
    and an easy-going nature.">Very flexible</option>

<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Quite flexible. A wand with this flexibility will pose little to no difficulty to whoever possesses it with the exception of owners
    it considers restrictive and/or boring. It is particularly good for transfiguration, spell crafting, healing magic,
    and curses. The owner of this wand is usually very likable as a result of being diplomatic and able to see all sides
    of a situation. They may be very indecisive, but they do have a few principles on which they believe very strongly
    in.">Quite flexible</option>

<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Supple. A wand with this flexibility needs a little time before it will warm up to its owner, but once it does, it will
    become very loyal. Once it has become loyal to an owner, it will have difficulty performing for a new owner unless
    that owner has a particularly dominating or forceful personality. It is particularly good for healing magic and any
    magic needed for potions or domestic activities like cooking. Supple wand owners are usually gentle, warm, humble,
    and kind-hearted. They may need to be careful about not burning themselves out in an attempt to please everyone.">Supple</option>

<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Reasonably supple. A wand with this flexibility will take even more time than a supple wand before warming up to its owner, but it also
    will become very loyal once it does. Unlike supple wands, however, it will have difficulty performing for any new
    owner unless they prove their worthiness. Reasonably supple wands are usually well-rounded and perform average or
    well in just about every area of magic except for curses and jinxes. Owners of wands with this flexibility are
    patient and kind, but they have limits to this patience and kindness. They are not as likely to burn themselves out
    in an attempt to please everyone, but it is still possible.">Reasonably supple</option>

<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Pliant. A wand with this flexibility will warm up easily to just about anyone; although, its full potential will not be
    unlocked until its owner has reached his or her full potential as well. This wand’s talents will depend solely upon
    the owner’s own talents, and its weaknesses will depend solely upon its owner’s weaknesses. Pliant wand owners are
    eager, enthusiastic, and tend to be very easily impressed and/or naive. They often have a zest for life that is rare
    and unrivaled in most populations.">Pliant</option>

<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Slightly yielding. A wand with this flexibility will initially resist new owners, but if the owner is persistent, it will warm up
    eventually. It is particularly good for spells involving potion-making, animal-taming, and defensive magic,
    although, it may have a little bit of difficulty with nonverbal magic. Wand owners with slightly yielding wands are
    often very kind and compassionate, but they may have some reluctance in trusting others since they possess a strong
    sense of skepticism. It usually takes a lot of strong arguing before the owner of this wand will believe claims that
    don’t make any sense to them.">Slightly yielding</option>

<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Brittle. A wand with this flexibility tends to attach itself quickest to owners who have insecurities, and its level of
    loyalty is often dependent on how loyal the owner is to it. Should it become very loyal to its original owner, new
    owners often won’t get the chance to earn the wand’s loyalty before it breaks. Brittle wands are best suited to
    subtle and delicate magic, such as transfiguration and non-verbal spell-casting. Because they break easy, their
    owners should be careful to avoid magic that is unnecessarily flashy or explosive, especially if the wand also has a
    dragon heartstring core. Owners with this wand flexibility are usually contemplative, clever, and somewhat cynical;
    they tend to be an “underdog” type of person and perhaps even a little bit unlucky, which could lead them to
    becoming resentful of their more successful peers. If a brittle wand owner perseveres and manages to get over their
    insecurities, however, he or she will often become a “great success story” that never ceases to amaze and inspire
    others.">Brittle a</option>

<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Hard. A wand of this flexibility is very difficult to work with and its loyalty is not won easily. Hard wands are great for
    complex and advanced levels of magic, so beginning wizards and witches may find extra difficulty with this wand when
    it doesn’t perform well for simple magic. As such, this type of wand is best suited for wizards and witches who are
    gifted, stubborn, and never give up. Owners of this wand also have a tendency to view things in absolutes; black or
    white. Some people may find them intimidating or difficult to approach.">Hard</option>

<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Solid. A wand of this flexibility will become extremely loyal to one owner and one owner only, usually people of great moral
    integrity. It is a wand that usually heavily specializes in only one area of magic of its owner’s choosing. Owners
    of this wand are generally known for their reliability, their friendliness, and their character. They may find it
    difficult to understand views that differ from their own but are usually able to politely disagree.">Solid</option>

<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Rigid. A wand of this flexibility will only give its complete loyalty to an owner who has faced great personal tragedy. It
    is particularly good for practical magic use, and thus usually doesn’t perform well for magic that is frivolous or
    silly. Rigid wand owners are cautious and have difficulty trusting others, but they are not usually unkind people.
    Generally, they prefer to be left alone so that they can do what they want to do, regardless of what anyone else
    says.">Rigid</option>

<option value= "You'll find that your wand is Unyielding. A wand of this flexibility finely tunes itself to its original owner’s preferences and doesn’t stray from those
    preferences, even in the hands of a new owner; the new owner will just have to get used to it. It is particularly
    good for combative and healing magic. Unyielding wand owners tend to be very confident in themselves and/or in the
    things they believe in. They tend to be intelligent, somewhat cynical, and usually have well-defined principles that
    they will not stray from ever. Sometimes, this combination can lead to arrogance because of them insisting on how
    right they are without considering other points of view or whether or not they might be wrong.">Unyielding</option>
