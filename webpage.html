                <p>You can purchase characters by sending the needed number of points from your character accounts to

                <p>
                <h2>the year is 2030</h2> Darkness has overtaken the magical world of the United Kingdom in ways never
                before seen. While most just try to live their lives peacefully, others seek to disrupt the status quo
                and revolutionize the foundations on which their world stands.</p>
                <p>The Ministry—while losing more and more control every day—has started to employ quasi-fascist tactics
                    to quell the unrest. Corruption by means of bribery, extortion, nepotism, and criminal enterprise
                    are rampant among the higher-ups, and with so much political power, they seem to be able to get away
                    with it easily.</p>
                <p>Dangerous factions of wix have started to make themselves known, some oppressing through subversion
                    and Ministry influence while others commit outright anarchistic acts of magical terror in an attempt
                    to enforce their own rules and laws—or lack thereof.</p>
                <p>In an age where technology and interconnectedness have given everyone’s desires and fears a voice,
                    the only question that remains is: <i>Whose will be the loudest?</i>

                <h2>DRAGON</h2> There is nothing subtle about you. You are large and fiery, and people notice you when
                you enter the room. You bring energy and adventure with you.</p>
                <p>Because there is so much of you, though, you may have trouble seeing past yourself. You might have
                    difficulty grasping the other side of an argument or working with other people’s communication
                    styles.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                <h2>OCCAMY</h2> You have a gift for adapting to any situation you end up in. You can pick up skills
                quickly and have a knack for knowing which ones are most relevant to the task at hand. It is difficult
                to take you by surprise.</p>
                <p>Because you are so accustomed to adapting to new environments, you may have trouble developing a firm
                    sense of your own identity. Perhaps you find yourself adjusting so much to make other people happy,
                    you forget to nurture yourself.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                <h2>THESTRAL</h2> The way you think is different from the way most of the people around you do. You are
                drawn to the odd and mysterious, which keeps your mind creative and unique. You bond very well with
                others like you.</p>
                <p>You probably feel out of place fairly often. Maybe you feel invisible because people avoid you, as
                    they feel something about you is foreign to their way of thinking and being comfortable.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                <h2>BASILISK</h2> People can tell that they shouldn’t mess with you. There is an air of power about you,
                an aura that can be intimidating and yet also protective. Instead of letting things slide, you will make
                your opinion and beliefs known.</p>
                <p>You may have trouble controlling your temper. You give in to aggressive tendencies even though you
                    know what you’re doing isn’t productive. You're likely mild mannered until someone does something
                    that offends you or those you love--then all bets are off.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                <h2>NIFFLER</h2> You value financial stability, so it’s fortunate that you seem to have an inborn talent
                to prosper when it comes to material wealth. You don’t mind hard work, and you’re willing to search in
                the nitty-gritty for whatever will help you excel.</p>
                <p>You might be a workaholic. The pressure you place on yourself to succeed could be toxic, both to you
                    and your loved ones. You might have trouble appreciating the good things in life that don’t cost any
                    money.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                <h2>HIPPOGRIFF</h2> You function in the world with your head held high because you know you deserve to.
                You are well aware of what your skills and abilities are, and you have put the work in to earn them.</p>
                <p>People might see you as a snob, though, and you may contribute to that by having an over-inflated
                    sense of your achievements. You may have a habit of overlooking the work other people do.</p>
                <br>
                <p>
                <h2>UNICORN</h2> You are beautiful but deadly. People are drawn to you because they see you shine, but
                you also carry a profoundly dangerous weapon, and you know how to use it. You will defend your loved
                ones and your ideals to the death.</p>
                <p>It is possible that you use this weapon to keep people away. You may be overly picky when it comes to
                    who you spend your time with, and this might leave you more alone than you ever wanted to be.</p>

                <h2>half/quarter-giant</h2> A Giant is a magical creature that can grow as tall as twenty-five feet, but
                otherwise they generally appear human-like. Giants are their own species but are capable of
                interbreeding with humans. Because they have volatile tempers and tend to live in isolated tribes,
                rarely interacting with other species for long, full Giants are not playable. Part-Giants, however, are
                playable.
                <br>
                <br>Part-Giants are taller than other humans, but they generally don't exceed twelve feet in height.
                Like Giants, they don't have significant magical abilities and in fact they are far more likely to have
                difficulty learning magic or be born as Squibs. Advanced magic will generally be beyond them, and when
                they go into specialized fields at all they are far more likely to excel in practical fields like
                herbology or caring for magical creatures. What they lack in magical ability they make up for in
                strength and resilience. They have preternatural strength, moreso than any of our other species, and
                they are resistant to many spells including, for example, the Stunning Spell.
                <br>
                <br>Part-Giants, like Giants, seem to have a particular vulnerability with their eyes that can
                potentially be exploited when other spells fail. They have no other specific vulnerabilities, but that's
                because in the end they aren't all that much more difficult to kill than other species. Their resistance
                to spells doesn't apply to the Killing Curse, for example; they're as susceptible to it as most other
                species. While the average lifespan of Giants is unknown, the average lifespan of Part-Giants seems to
                be about the same as the average Wixen lifespan.</p>
                <p>
                <h2>veela</h2> A Veela is a semi-human magical being who appears quite beautiful to others, with
                white-gold hair and moon-bright skin. Veela are a born species, not a transformed species, native to
                Bulgaria. They are now few in number, particularly outside Bulgaria, and tend to mate with human Wixen
                quite often, which means there are few living Veela outside their homeland but Part-Veela may be a bit
                more common. Their average lifespans are similar to those of Wixen.
                <br>
                <br>Veela are hypnotically seductive to those attracted to people of their gender, though it was once
                believed only female Veela had this effect on human men. That has since proven not to be the case. Their
                looks alone are seductive, but their dance is almost impossible to resist, and can lead to impulsive and
                foolish behavior to gain the Veela's attention and admiration. This is, of course, an ability the Veela
                could choose to exploit in order to gain power and influence. Like Wixen, Veela are inherently capable
                of their own type of magic as well, which does not require a wand.
                <br>
                <br>When angered, a full Veela can shapeshift into a creature with a beaked, bird-like head and scaly
                wings protruding from their shoulders, capable of launching fireballs from their hands. Sometimes this
                transformation can be involuntarily provoked if the Veela is angry enough and not sufficiently in
                control of their power. This power becomes more difficult for Part-Veela, and is said not to be possible
                at all for those who are less than one-eighth Veela. Part-Veela can only sustain this transformation for
                short periods of time -- a matter of minutes, most likely, and certainly no more than an hour at a time.
                <br>
                <br>A Veela has no special vulnerabilties, but that's because they can be killed just as easily as a
                human being. It's said in Muggle folklore that plucking a single hair from a Veela's head will kill them
                or permanently force them into their non-human form; it's unknown where this lore originated, but it's
                inaccurate, and in fact Veela sometimes voluntarily give or sell their hair for use in wandmaking. There
                may be a grain of truth to the Muggle folklore in that the power of the Veela's hair that makes it
                useful for wandmaking may relate to the Veela's overall power and ability to control it, but that's
                uncertain. Plucking a single hair seems to have no effect.</p>

                <h2>werewolf</h2>A werewolf is a person who, at the zenith of the full moon’s rise, becomes a fearsome
                and deadly wolf. Caused by an infection called lycanthropy, also known as werewolfry, there is currently
                no known cure for this affliction.
                <br>
                <br>The <b>alpha</b> is the leader of the pack. There is never more than one alpha of any single pack,
                though if a pack is large enough, the alpha can delegate into sub-packs which have their own sub-alphas
                who still report and submit to the alpha. The <b>betas</b>
                make up the majority of the pack. These wolves serve the pack in many different facets of life, whether
                it be financially, emotionally, physically, or otherwise. Each beta has their own place among the ranks
                and is valued by the pack for their contributions. The <b>omega</b> is the lowest member on the totem
                pole of the pack. Should a new wolf join the pack, they are generally perceived to be the omega unless
                it is determined otherwise by the alpha. A <b>lone wolf</b> is simply a werewolf who is not part of a
                pack. They can be in search of one, or simply prefer to not be part of a pack. These wolves will have a
                much more difficult transformation during the full moon.
                <br>
                <br>Werewolves have heightened senses and strength regardless of which form they are in, however, in
                their human form, both are somewhat dulled. Their senses will pick up anything within about 1/4-1/2 mile
                in human form, depending on how much noise is around them.
                <br>
                <br>Werewolves truly become lethal in their wolf form. Due to the variance in size, their strength level
                can greatly fluctuate from one wolf to the next. In their wolf form, they can distinguish a person by
                scent or sound from nearly a mile away if they know what the person smells and sounds like. Most
                werewolves rely more strongly on their sense of smell than anything else.
                <br>
                <br>The vast majority of werewolves are created with a bite from a werewolf during the full moon. A
                powdery mixture of silver and dittany applied to a fresh bite will cause the wound to seal. Sometimes
                the blood loss and trauma of the injury are too great even for the salve to save the newly bitten. Due
                to the traumatic aspects of the actual attack, it is very rare that children survive being bitten to see
                their first change.
                <br>
                <br>The curse passes in the introduction of a werewolf’s saliva into the victim’s bloodstream. If a
                bite, or scratch, were to take place outside the full moon, the victim would develop more lupine
                tendencies, but they would not become a werewolf. For example, they might discover a new taste for
                extremely rare meat, have higher natural body temperatures, or have slightly higher-than-normal senses.
                Any scratch or bite from these creatures will leave permanent scars, and most generally will require
                healing.
                <br>
                <br>The first change for a werewolf is a very long, very painful experience, as their body breaks and
                shatters in order to alter into the form of a wolf. Once the full shift is complete, they will appear as
                larger-than-average wolves. Often, there will be similarities between the lupine and human forms, such
                as coat or eye color remaining the same. Any defining physical marks - scars, deformities, etc. - will
                remain on the wolf as they appear on the human form.
                <br>
                <br>The Wolfsbane potion will relieve the effects of the change - though it will not delay or cease the
                transformation into a wolf - and will allow the werewolf to retain their human faculties throughout the
                duration of their shift. Unfortunately, it is a complex and highly expensive potion, and not all
                werewolves are lucky enough to have a means to access it regularly, if at all. When the moon sets, and
                the first light of dawn touches the sky, the curse will be lifted until the next full lunar phase. At
                this point the werewolf is able to return to its human form - their first time taking the longest and
                being the most painful - and the memories of their time as a wolf will remain with them.
                <br>
                <br>The longer a werewolf is afflicted, the more control they will gain over these shifts. The act of
                changing from one form to another will gradually recede in pain and duration, and eventually they will
                be able to call upon the wolf outside of the full moon at will. While they will never escape the forcing
                change of the full moon’s presence, with the help of a wolfsbane potion and some practice in the change,
                their quality of life does stand a chance of improvement.
                <br>
                <br>The few born werewolves have a slightly different experience; they are just as much a slave to the
                full moon as a bitten werewolf, but they are given the natural luxury of less painful shifts and more
                control over their animal counterpart. It is easier for them to gain dominion over their lupine side, as
                it is a part of them from birth.
                <br>
                <br>Partial shifts can be experienced by all werewolves in varying appearances. Those with more control
                over their lupine self can halt the shift at will to remain in a suspended state of transitioning - with
                the exception of trying to halt the shift during the full moon. This can be in the purpose of growing
                claws, or fangs, or even to improve eyesight via lupine vision. For wolves lacking the control or
                experience to call this partial shift at will, it can take place during instances of heightened emotion;
                such as fear, anger, even sexual arousal can trigger the wolf at times.
                <br>
                <br>Perhaps the only true gift lycanthropy offers its victims is the quickened rate at which they heal.
                Small cuts and bruises can disappear in a matter of hours, and even broken bones will not keep them down
                for long. They can still be wounded mortally, usually by spells or at the aggression of another
                werewolf, but their increased healing offers them a chance to reach assistance where a normal human/wix
                would be bleeding out in a matter of seconds.
                <br>
                <br>A werewolf’s apparent age directly relates to its symbiosis with their lupine self. More simply put,
                a werewolf who handles the shifts well or might give themselves over to the lycanthropy curse would
                appear more healthy and youthful than a werewolf who resisted their lupine counterpart and tried
                fighting the curse whom would appear more haggard and older than their true age. This means that you
                might find a seventy year old werewolf who still appears in their forties, just as easily as finding a
                werewolf in their thirties who look like they could be pushing sixty.
                <br>
                <br>In terms of actual aging, a werewolf’s lifespan can extend past that of a normal wixen’s due to the
                healing associated with their affliction. Their bodies can regenerate dead or dying cells at a faster
                rate, which can prolong their life considerably. There are no irrefutable records of werewolf mortality
                ages, considering how many of them choose to remain anonymous, but it is thought that none of them have
                lived past one hundred and fifty years of age.
                <br>
                <br>The growth rate of one's werewolf directly reflects how much time the individual spends in that
                form.
                <br>
                <br>There has been much speculation on the ability of a werewolf in the topic of reproduction. To put it
                bluntly, yes, a werewolf is capable of having children, but different circumstances will produce
                different offspring. Normally, when a werewolf is in human form, they are perfectly capable of producing
                a healthy, normal child as the werewolf gene does not pass on during reproduction as a human. The child
                has a 50% chance of being born with heightened senses or slightly enhanced physical strength. The
                likelihood of the child being a wix is the same for those born to a werewolf wixen as any other wix.</p>

                <h3>Abilities</h3>
                <h2>animagus</h2>
                An Animagus is a Wix who can transform into an animal and back into human form at will. This is a
                learned skill rather than an inherited trait, and because of the difficulty in both learning how to
                self-transfigure and the potion and ritual for becoming an Animagus, it's somewhat rare. It would be
                rarer still to find anyone becoming an Animagus before reaching adulthood.<p>

                    An Animagus can take the form of only <i>one</i> specific animal, which will be determined by their
                    personality and inner traits. It could be similar or identical to their Patronus, but may not be in
                    every case, and an Animagus should never take the form of a magical creature. An Animagus' animal
                    form would bear some identifying mark in common with their human form, like the same dental
                    structure or a pattern in the shape of their eyeglasses, and significant physical changes like loss
                    of a limb would also be reflected in the Animagus' animal form.
                <p>

                    All Animagi must register with the Ministry of Magic, and failure to do so could result in trial and
                    imprisonment in Azkaban upon being caught.
                <p>

                <h2>metamorphmagus</h2>
                A Metamorphmagus is a Wix who can alter their appearance at will, sometimes drastically. This is an
                inherited trait rather than a learned skill, though mastering the ability likely requires learning
                either from someone else or through self-exploration. It would be rare to find a Metamorphmagus able to
                master a complete change to their appearance before reaching adulthood, though it may be possible if the
                Metamorphmagus is taught how to master their ability from an early age, e.g., by a parent, relative, or
                other mentor who also has the ability. A Metamorphmagus' ability would manifest early on in life, often
                as early as infancy.<p>

                    While a Metamorphmagus can alter their appearance, even to the point of looking like a different
                    person or even another gender, they aren't capable of shapeshifting into the appearance of an animal
                    or other species that is non-humanoid in appearance. Metamorphmagi can also lack control over their
                    powers at times; for example, they can find their hair or eyes involuntarily changing colors as
                    emotional responses, or they can even sometimes find themselves unable to use their ability during
                    times of great emotional upheaval.
                <p>
                <h2>seer</h2>
                A Seer is a Wix who is proficient in divination, which usually involves a combination of both natural
                aptitude and learned skill. A Seer would be proficient in only one specialized field of divination:
                Retrocognition, seeing glimpses of the past; Precognition, seeing glimpses of the future; Geocognition,
                being able to determine the location of people or objects; or Empathy, being able to discern others'
                emotions. Divination can take a variety of forms, including but not limited to the use of objects such
                as runes or tea leaves, or the natural occurrence of visions.<p>

                    Divination is extremely difficult, even for those with a natural aptitude, and thus in most cases a
                    Seer would only see brief glimpses of the past or future, determine vague locations, or discern very
                    basic emotional impressions. Being able to do more than this, as with most of our abilities, would
                    require advanced learning and aptitude.
                <p>

                    Non-magical humans, such as squibs and muggles, can have residual traces of magic that allow them
                    limited divination aptitude. They would not be classified as Seers, but could have basic proficiency
                    in one of the above fields of divination. Think of those who claim to have psychic and empathic
                    abilities in the muggle world; that would be the same level of divination a squib or muggle would
                    experience.
                <p>
                <h2>parselmouth</h2>
                A Parselmouth is a Wix who can speak and understand Parseltongue, the language of serpents, which makes
                the Parselmouth able to converse with serpents. This includes serpentine magical creatures, including
                the Basilisk and the Runespoor. Parseltongue is an inherited trait rather than a learned skill, and is
                quite rare. The vast majority of Parselmouths are descendants of Salazar Slytherin, though it's possible
                the trait is not exclusive to Slytherin lineage.<p>

                    Although Parseltongue is usually spoken with serpents, those who are more proficient in the language
                    can also speak it with each other. Because few who aren't Parselmouths can understand even a little
                    bit of the language, it will just sound like a hissing sound to most people. Albus Dumbledore was
                    the only known exception to being able to recognize and understad Parseltongue without being a
                    Parselmouth, so that is quite rare and should not be possible except for the most advanced Wixen.
                <p>
                    <br>
                <h2>nonverbal magic</h2>
                Non-verbal magic is taught in the sixth and seventh years at Hogwarts in Charms, DADA, and
                Transfiguration classes. Most Wixen will be proficient in at least some non-verbal magic from then on,
                because they are required to begin performing magic in these classes non-verbally. It's still worth
                noting students before their sixth year would be unlikely to know much if any non-verbal magic, and
                non-verbal magic can still be difficult. It's not recommended to try to cast more advanced spells, such
                as the Patronus Charm, non-verbally. The success of non-verbal magic can also depend a great deal on a
                Wix's wand.<p>

                    If you have questions about this, please don't hesitate to ask. We don't include non-verbal magic
                    among our Abilities claims because it's a relatively common ability, but we wanted members to
                    understand it still has its limits.
                <p>
                    <br>
                <h2>wandless magic</h2>
                Wandless magic is not common in much of the Western world and Asia, though it is more common in Africa,
                the African diaspora, and among Native Americans. When wands are culturally common, they are used to
                channel the Wix's magic, and trying to perform magic without them can often have unintended and volatile
                results. In such cultures, only the most adept Wixen would be able to effectively perform wandless
                magic. Charms and Transfiguration are particularly difficult without wands.<p>
                    <br>
                <h2>patronus</h2>
                The Patronus Charm is one of the most powerful defensive spells in a Wix's arsenal, and one of the most
                advanced. Being able to cast a fully corporeal Patronus is even more difficult and advanced than casting
                an incorporeal Patronus. That said, in recent years it has become more common, as it is now being taught
                as part of the Defense Against the Dark Arts curriculum in a student's sixth and seventh years at
                Hogwarts. It is now required to be able to cast an incorporeal Patronus for an O on the DADA N.E.W.T.,
                but an E can still be achieved without casting a Patronus.<p>

                    The Patronus is cast with the incantation <i>Expecto Patronum;</i> it is too advanced a spell to be
                    cast wandlessly or non-verbally except by the most adept Wixen, unless a Wix is from a culture in
                    which wandless magic is common. The Patronus generally relies on the Wix concentrating on their
                    happiest memory while casting the charm. The Patronus can be used to repel Dementors and Lethifolds,
                    and is the only known repellent against them. It can also be used to repel Vampires, along with
                    other known repellents. Finally, it can be used as a form of communication by sending a miniature
                    version of one's Patronus to deliver a verbal message, though this is quite advanced.
                <p>
                    <br>
                <h2>legilimency</h2>
                A Legilimens is a Wix who can magically delve into the thoughts, memories, and emotions of others.
                Legilimency is usually a learned skill, though it seems some exceptionally talented Wixen have a natural
                aptitude for it that doesn't require much training in the skill. This would be quite rare.<p>

                    Legilimency usually requires a wand and use of the incantation <i>Legilimens,</i> though it can be
                    performed non-verbally and wandlessly by the most advanced Legilimens, who may also be capable of
                    planting thoughts, memories, and emotions into the target's mind. Even in the case of advanced
                    Legilimency, the target will likely be aware Legilimency is occurring. Legilimency is easier if the
                    practitioner's and target's eyes meet.

                <h2>occlumency</h2>
                An Occlumens is a Wix who can magically close their mind against Legilimency. This can prevent a
                Legilimens both from seeing the Wix's own thoughts, memories, and emotions, as well as preventing them
                from planting thoughts, memories, and emotions in the Wix's mind. Occlumency is a learned skill that
                requires a great deal of willpower, though a Wix may have a natural aptitude for it that makes learning
                easier.<p>

                    The most basic method of Occlumency involves clearing the mind of all thoughts, memories, and
                    emotions. A more advanced Occlumens would be able to create a false layer of thoughts, memories, or
                    emotions for the Legilimens to find, so they would be unable to detect the use of Occlumency and
                    believe they've successfully penetrated the Occlumens' mind. This latter method of Occlumency would
                    be possible for only the most advanced Occlumens, not a beginner.

Paired with a sincere, self-aware owner, however, it becomes one of the most loyal and impressive wands of all, with a particular flair in all kinds of charmwork. ">

The old superstition, ‘wand of elder, never prosper,’ has its basis in this fear of the wand, but in fact, the superstition is baseless, and those foolish wandmakers who refuse to work with elder do so more because they doubt they will be able to sell their products than from fear of working with this wood. The truth is that only a highly unusual person will find their perfect match in elder, and on the rare occasion when such a pairing occurs, I take it as certain that the witch or wizard in question is marked out for a special destiny.

The oak tree is called King of the Forest from the winter solstice up until the summer solstice, and its wood should only be collected during that time (holly becomes King as the days begin to shorten again, and so holly should only be gathered as the year wanes. This divide is believed to be the origin of the old superstition, ‘When his wand’s oak and hers is holly, then to marry would be folly,’ a superstition that I have found baseless).

Hawthorn wands may be particularly suited to healing magic, but they are also adept at curses, and I have generally observed that the hawthorn wand seems most at home with a conflicted nature, or with a witch or wizard passing through a period of turmoil.

The positive aspect of a hazel wand more than makes up for such minor discomforts, however, for it is capable of outstanding magic in the hands of the skillful, and is so devoted to its owner that it often ‘wilts’ (which is to say, it expels all its magic and refuses to perform, often necessitating the extraction of the core and its insertion into another casing, if the wand is still required) at the end of its master’s life (if the core is unicorn hair, however, there is no hope; the wand will almost certainly have ‘died’).

When demand was at its height, wandmaker Arturo Cephalopos claimed that the association between silver lime and clairvoyance was ‘a falsehood circulated by merchants like Gerbold Ollivander (my own grandfather), who have overstocked their workshops with silver lime and hope to shift their surplus’.

Quintana's wands produced spells of force and elegance. Quintana's harvesting of White River Monster spines initially raised concerns of over-fishing, but because he was the only one who knew how to lure the creatures, the ecological impact was not severe. White River Monster spines were no longer used as a wand core after Quintana's death, as he took the secret of luring the creature to his grave.">

The scales and hair from a mermaid are very strong magical conductors and often only given from family member to family member. It is very rare that I see this core in the modern times as it isn’t often mermaid families create new wands. This core is again very loyal to his wielder and very difficult to wield if taken or won. Though this wand can be very temperamental as it only likes to be held by wielders who are very knowledgeable but not greedy. If the wielder is neither than it is more likely that this wand will not be allied with them. If a wand is allied with a wielder who is neither than it will take time before the wand is strong but when it becomes close to its wielder than it will be very loyal, as well as strong. Overall the mermaid cores do well with outdoorsy elements and care of magical creatures. Mermaid Scales do well with Transfiguration, and singers will love a wand with Mermaid’s Scale as it lends a beautiful melody to the voice when used for amplification spells, however this core can also make for a very vain wand. Do not compliment any other wands in its presence, or humans, or animals, or jewelry. In fact it’s best their owner hates everything, less they find themselves drowned in a puddle.">

                            value="and you'll find that your wand is surprisingly swishy. A wand with this flexibility will either surprise its owner by being surprisingly loyal or surprisingly unloyal and is most often known for doing the unexpected. It is usually great for charm work. Owners that are matched with wands of this flexibility are usually the type of people who have a hard time coming out of their shell or opening up, but once they do, others will find themselves drawn to their charming, fun-loving personalities. The owner usually adapts well to unexpected changes but may find it difficult to make hard decisions.">

                            value="and you'll find that your wand is Swishy. A wand with this flexibility may not be too loyal to its owner and may switch loyalties at a moment’s notice. It is particularly good at charms. Owners that are matched with wands of this flexibility may be very sociable and fun-loving with a penchant for some mischief-making. They are usually very clever and prefer not to tie themselves down to any particular way of thinking until they’ve gathered all that they need to know.">

                            value="and you'll find that your wand is Slightly springy. A wand with this flexibility may not appear to be very loyal at all because they will initially take to new owners quite well, but the fact of the matter is that they will always have a special tie to their original owner. As time goes on, this wand will become increasingly more troublesome for any owner that isn’t its original owner until finally it stops working altogether. This wand is good for crafting spells. Owners matched with this wand may be very cheerful and optimistic, but most of all, they have very big (and possibly overactive) imaginations. Their thought patterns tend to be outside of the box.">

                            value="and you'll find that your wand is Fairly bendy. A wand with this flexibility tends to be very loyal to its original owner; if it finds itself in a new owner’s hands, it will make itself difficult to work with, but with time, it will eventually warm up to a new owner. This wand is not exceptional at any particular branch of magic but is well-rounded enough that it will do well or average in every area. Owners of a fairly bendy wand are well-liked but pride themselves on trying to stand out from the crowd. Unfortunately, some of them may be quite susceptible to peer pressure, usually brought on by being in a group considered “different” from others.">

A wand with this flexibility is happy in anyone’s hands, but this disadvantage is somewhat off-set by the fact that this wand does exceptionally well in just about every area of magic. Owners of this wand flexibility come with a very wide variety of personalities, but they do share a very high level of adaptability to just about any situation and an easy-going nature.">

                            value="and you'll find that your wand is Quite flexible. A wand with this flexibility will pose little to no difficulty to whoever possesses it with the exception of owners it considers restrictive and/or boring. It is particularly good for transfiguration, spell crafting, healing magic, and curses. The owner of this wand is usually very likable as a result of being diplomatic and able to see all sides of a situation. They may be very indecisive, but they do have a few principles on which they believe very strongly in.">

                            value="and you'll find that your wand is Supple. A wand with this flexibility needs a little time before it will warm up to its owner, but once it does, it will become very loyal. Once it has become loyal to an owner, it will have difficulty performing for a new owner unless that owner has a particularly dominating or forceful personality. It is particularly good for healing magic and any magic needed for potions or domestic activities like cooking. Supple wand owners are usually gentle, warm, humble, and kind-hearted. They may need to be careful about not burning themselves out in an attempt to please everyone.">

                            value="and you'll find that your wand is Reasonably supple. A wand with this flexibility will take even more time than a supple wand before warming up to its owner, but it also will become very loyal once it does. Unlike supple wands, however, it will have difficulty performing for any new owner unless they prove their worthiness. Reasonably supple wands are usually well-rounded and perform average or well in just about every area of magic except for curses and jinxes. Owners of wands with this flexibility are patient and kind, but they have limits to this patience and kindness. They are not as likely to burn themselves out in an attempt to please everyone, but it is still possible.">

                            value="and you'll find that your wand is Pliant. A wand with this flexibility will warm up easily to just about anyone; although, its full potential will not be unlocked until its owner has reached his or her full potential as well. This wand’s talents will depend solely upon the owner’s own talents, and its weaknesses will depend solely upon its owner’s weaknesses. Pliant wand owners are eager, enthusiastic, and tend to be very easily impressed and/or naive. They often have a zest for life that is rare and unrivaled in most populations.">

                            value="and you'll find that your wand is Slightly yielding. A wand with this flexibility will initially resist new owners, but if the owner is persistent, it will warm up eventually. It is particularly good for spells involving potion-making, animal-taming, and defensive magic, although, it may have a little bit of difficulty with nonverbal magic. Wand owners with slightly yielding wands are often very kind and compassionate, but they may have some reluctance in trusting others since they possess a strong sense of skepticism. It usually takes a lot of strong arguing before the owner of this wand will believe claims that don’t make any sense to them.">

                            value="and you'll find that your wand is Brittle. A wand with this flexibility tends to attach itself quickest to owners who have insecurities, and its level of loyalty is often dependent on how loyal the owner is to it. Should it become very loyal to its original owner, new owners often won’t get the chance to earn the wand’s loyalty before it breaks. Brittle wands are best suited to subtle and delicate magic, such as transfiguration and non-verbal spell-casting. Because they break easy, their owners should be careful to avoid magic that is unnecessarily flashy or explosive, especially if the wand also has a dragon heartstring core. Owners with this wand flexibility are usually contemplative, clever, and somewhat cynical; they tend to be an “underdog” type of person and perhaps even a little bit unlucky, which could lead them to becoming resentful of their more successful peers. If a brittle wand owner perseveres and manages to get over their insecurities, however, he or she will often become a “great success story” that never ceases to amaze and inspire others.">

                            value="and you'll find that your wand is Hard. A wand of this flexibility is very difficult to work with and its loyalty is not won easily. Hard wands are great for complex and advanced levels of magic, so beginning wizards and witches may find extra difficulty with this wand when it doesn’t perform well for simple magic. As such, this type of wand is best suited for wizards and witches who are gifted, stubborn, and never give up. Owners of this wand also have a tendency to view things in absolutes; black or white. Some people may find them intimidating or difficult to approach.">

                            value="and you'll find that your wand is Solid. A wand of this flexibility will become extremely loyal to one owner and one owner only, usually people of great moral integrity. It is a wand that usually heavily specializes in only one area of magic of its owner’s choosing. Owners of this wand are generally known for their reliability, their friendliness, and their character. They may find it difficult to understand views that differ from their own but are usually able to politely disagree.">

                            value="and you'll find that your wand is Rigid. A wand of this flexibility will only give its complete loyalty to an owner who has faced great personal tragedy. It is particularly good for practical magic use, and thus usually doesn’t perform well for magic that is frivolous or silly. Rigid wand owners are cautious and have difficulty trusting others, but they are not usually unkind people. Generally, they prefer to be left alone so that they can do what they want to do, regardless of what anyone else says.">

                            value="and you'll find that your wand is Unyielding. A wand of this flexibility finely tunes itself to its original owner’s preferences and doesn’t stray from those preferences, even in the hands of a new owner; the new owner will just have to get used to it. It is particularly good for combative and healing magic. Unyielding wand owners tend to be very confident in themselves and/or in the things they believe in. They tend to be intelligent, somewhat cynical, and usually have well-defined principles that they will not stray from ever. Sometimes, this combination can lead to arrogance because of them insisting on how right they are without considering other points of view or whether or not they might be wrong.">

                <h2>Times Change</h2> It's not as though fighting was ever <i>unpopular.</i> There have always been
                dueling clubs in the wixen world. There have always been physical fight enthusiasts, too, keeping boxing
                gyms and martial arts studios in business and thriving. The urge to battle is simply a part of human
                nature, and people will always manage to experience it in some way, shape, or form.
                <br>
                <br>It all became very real during the war, though, and afterwards things felt different. For many,
                there wasn't much of a thrill to be found anymore in the strictly controlled rings they had frequented
                previously. There were <i>laws,</i> things you simply weren't allowed to do, and plenty of people
                responded with resistance. They had seen the real thing now, and they were loath to go back to an
                activity with such low stakes.
                <br>
                <br>Boxers are wix/humans who fight without use of wands (and technically magic). Duelists use their
                wands in the traditional form of wix dueling. Brawlers are various shapeshifters including werewolves,
                animagi, and other wix or sentient creature able to take the form of something other than a human in
                order to fight. Referees act as bouncers and security for both the crowd and the fighters.

                <h2>Enter the Reviled</h2> And so the anarchists saw an opportunity to profit. They put down money for
                the development of London's illegal fighting scene and employed established criminals to make it happen.
                By now, business is booming and the higher-ups are able to rake in quite a fortune.

                <br>The arena itself is literally underground, its exact location known only to very few people. Access
                is granted via a rotating set of several cleverly hidden portkeys and vanishing cabinets. On alternating
                nights, combatants can participate in magical duels and brutal boxing matches. Gambling is encouraged,
                and death in the ring is simply accepted as one of the risks.

                <p>
                <h2>Nox</h2> It started out as a pain potion, and in the aftermath of the war, plenty of people were in
                need of it. So many were grievously injured, stuck in St. Mungo's for months, writhing in agony as
                healers worked a mile a minute to develop cures for new curses they had never seen before. Combining an
                already existing pain potion with the distilled buds of the willoweed bush, a young potioneer created
                something brand new. She called it <b>pulchrinox</b>, and with it, healers could treat even the most
                desperate levels of pain.
                <br>
                <br>But the buds from the willoweed bush, as it turned out, are as profoundly addictive as they are
                powerful. By the time these grievously injured patients were ready to go home from the hospital, they
                were hooked. A weaning-off treatment was advised, and eventually it was discovered that the other parts
                of the willoweed bush only contained the painkiller properties and not the addictive ones. Thus
                <b>pseudonox</b> was developed, an alternative pain potion that, while being a bit less effective, was
                not habit-forming.
                <br>
                <br>But the damage had already been done. Family members of the injured had quickly begun experimenting
                with the drug, and they had found that it could ease mental pain as well as physical. Countless numbers
                of wixen who were suffering from the remnants of their wartime trauma found themselves addicted. And
                then, eventually, it gained the reputation of being just plain <i>enjoyable.</i>

                <h2>Lux</h2>By the time private use of the willoweed bush was banned, it had already spread far and wide
                among those who wanted to profit off of addicts. Less expensive blends of the drug were less pure,
                meaning more dangerous. The risk of addiction and overdose was absolutely massive. The dealers may not
                have been using the killing curse, but they were still just as culpable for widespread death and
                destruction.
                <br>
                <br>And then one of their potioneers had an idea. Their customers were dying because, once they were
                high on nox, all they wanted to do was take more, to sink further into that euphoria. What if they had
                another option? What if they created another drug, related to nox but an <i>upper</i>
                rather than a downer? It was genius. Present them as capable of cancelling each other out, even though
                in reality mixing them only increased the stress on the user's cardiovascular system. More ways for them
                to die, but also more ways to profit. To <i>double</i> that profit, even. Thus <b>pulchrilux</b> entered
                the scene.
                <br>
                <br>Unsurprisingly, by now there is an organized operation functioning beneath the surface of wixen
                society, devoted to creating and distributing the drug for monetary gain. People at the top are
                accumulating money at unprecedented rates. To them, it is still the miracle drug. To addicts, it has
                become their prison and, ultimately, their death.

                <h2>Pseudonox</h2> They aren't <i>completely</i> without recourse, though. There's still
                <b>pseudonox</b>, the non-habit-forming alternative to nox. Because quitting cold turkey is dangerous,
                addicts can be treated with pseudonox in order to help wean them off the drug. The problem is that this
                treatment costs money, and a stay in a rehabilitation center or hospital is expensive. Pseudonox is a
                strictly controlled substance, but those with darker motives can usually find some way to steal what
                they want.</p>

                <h3>Stonehenge Academy of Magical Arts</h3>
                <h2>Vires, Artes, Mores</h2>
                <p>Stonehenge Academy of Magical Arts was founded by Morgan le Fay and Merlin with the motto <i>“Vires,
                        Artes, Mores”</i> (Strength, Skill, Character). It gives young and old wixen alike the
                    opportunity to seek the knowledge of various specialized fields of magic. Stonehenge Academy’s
                    campus is hidden in plain sight a short distance from its namesake in Wiltshire, England. If a
                    muggle looks at the campus, all they see is a collection of run-down barns.</p>
                <p>Stonehenge Academy offers a two year program of study for each major. All majors have the option to
                    take an apprenticeship within that specific field for a third year of continued study. There are
                    also options for study beyond a third year and some fields, such as teaching, would require
                    continuous education throughout one's career. Each college has its own building and there are
                    student dormitories located on campus. The dormitories have quad and double layouts, with a limited
                    number of singles available for higher price. The university offers intramural quidditch and has a
                    quidditch pitch for students to have leisurely pick-up games.</p>
                <p>Wixen can access the campus through the Floo Network, which arrives in the Administration building;
                    the Knight Bus; or by apparating just outside of the campus grounds.</p>
                <h2>Fields of study</h2>
                <p>
                <h4>School of Charms</h4> <span>curses • jinxes • spells • theory</span>
                </p>
                <p>This school focuses on advanced charms work beyond what is learned at secondary schools. Each student
                    will learn not only such advanced charms but the theories underlying them. By the time they complete
                    their two-year course of study, students will have learned the most sophisticated charms, including
                    the patronus charm if they haven't yet mastered it.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>School of Defensive Magic</h4> <span>curse breaking • dark magic & creatures • dueling • ward
                    crafting</span>
                </p>
                <p>At this school, students will learn all the advanced skills necessary to become an officer of magical
                    law enforcement, including aurors and hit wix, as well as magic needed for fields such as curse
                    breaking, ward crafting, etc. Beyond the two-year course load, there is the option of a third year
                    apprenticeship in these fields as a substitute for their non-university training programs.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>School of Education</h4> <span>classroom management • communication • planning • research and
                    analysis</span>
                </p>
                <p>It's here that students learn the skills they need to become the professors who will teach the next
                    generation, either at secondary schools or universities throughout the world. Most within the School
                    of Education will also take extensive course work within the fields they will be teaching. It is
                    possible to attain simultaneous degrees from the School of Education and <i>one</i> other School at
                    Stonehenge within <b>one additional year</b> depending on the courses taken.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>School of Healing</h4> <span>diseases • illnesses • injuries • medications </span>
                </p>
                <p>Students in the School of Healing will be educated in healing magic so they can practice medicine at
                    magical hospitals, schools, or various private practices. There is a mandatory apprenticeship for
                    the School of Healing, usually at St. Mungo's (though the hospital wing of Hogwarts or other private
                    practices may qualify), as a third year program. Healing students often take classes in other fields
                    relevant to healing, including but not limited to herbology and potions.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>School of Herbology</h4> <span>botany • equipment • fertilizer • hazards</span>
                </p>
                <p>Herbology students will be prepared for engagement in a variety of fields ranging from magical botany
                    to medicinal herbology and everything in between. The advanced herbology taught at this school will
                    deal with magical plant life that is often rare, exotic, and potentially dangerous. Herbology
                    factors into many other fields so it isn't a surprise to find students of other majors in these
                    classes.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>School of Potions</h4> <span>hazards • experimentation • ingredients • instruments</span>
                </p>
                <p>In the School of Potions, students will learn to become more than mere potioneers; the goal for each
                    student will be to prepare them to become potion masters in the years following their advanced
                    education. There are a wide array of uses for potions, including medical uses, use in magical law
                    enforcement, and even tactical use, so students can find themselves going into a wide range of
                    fields after their potions education.</p>
                <p>
                <h4>School of Transfiguration</h4> <span>Conjuration • Transformation • Untransfiguration •
                    Vanishment</span>
                </p>
                <p>The main branches of study for transfiguration are the focal point of this school. Each student will
                    learn the intricate theories that eventually brought about each spell. By the time their two-year
                    course of study is complete, each student will have learned some of the subject's most complex
                    transfiguration magic, including the animagus transformation, if they have not mastered it before.
                </p>
                <p>
                <h4>School of Arts and Sciences</h4> <span>Alchemy • Ancient Runes • Arithmancy • Astronomy • Divination
                    • fine arts • History of Magic • Magizoology</span>
                </p>
                <p>This school offers course work in a variety of magical arts and sciences as well as fine arts and
                    muggle studies. Many students whose majors are in other schools will still take mandatory and
                    elective classes from this school relevant to their major fields of study. The school's wandmaking
                    program is a cross-disciplinary program that includes work in herbology and magizoology and has a
                    third year apprenticeship program. The School of Arts and Sciences includes an ever-changing
                    curriculum; the fixed areas of study are listed above.</p>

                <h3>The New War</h3>
                <h2>McGonagall's Army</h2>
                <p>What started as a Hogwarts club under the direction of the late Headmistress McGonagall to discuss
                    current
                    affairs within the wixen world, became the moniker of the resistance movement following McGonagall's
                    assassination in 2028. McGonagall's Army seeks to put
                    an end to the Devoted, the Reviled, and Ministry corruption. They are usually outnumbered
                    three-to-one at the very least, but that doesn't stop them from putting their lives on the line to
                    protect the population both magical and muggle in the UK and beyond. Led by the
                    reluctantly-deemed General and commanded by the Brigadiers, they do whatever they can to stop the
                    factions that seek to destroy London. Lieutenants play an active role in McGonagall's Army, and
                    recruiters hold jobs within Hogwarts, Stonehenge, the Ministry, and other places but are always on
                    the lookout for new members and allies, basically serving as spies as well.</p>

                <h2>The Devoted</h2>
                <p>Also known as the purists, the Devoted is a group of wix who seek to reestablish the rules and laws
                    of pureblooded magical supremacy over both wix and muggles. They are heavily infiltrated within the
                    Ministry, and in fact do most of their work through subversion and Ministry influence as well as
                    manipulation of the curriculum at Hogwarts and Stonehenge. The Devoted are quiet and stealthy, and
                    they tend to stick to the shadows.</p>

                <h2>The Reviled</h2>
                <p>Born from chaos, the reviled seek only to disrupt, sow destruction, and watch the world burn. They
                    practice dark magic just for the sake of it, and they take it out on both the magical and muggle
                    citizens of London in an effort to show that nothing is permanent and all can burn. They are run
                    like a cult and terror organization, though their only wish is to ensure that anarchy rules the
                    streets of the city. Led by the Prophet, strengthened by his Left and Right Hands followed closely
                    by his Left And Right
                    Arms, and protected by
                    the Centurions, everything they do is a mockery of societal norms and the status quo. The occultists
                    are free to study and do as they play so long as they don't betray the trust of other members or
                    reveal the location of their hideout.</p>

                <h2>Sanctuary</h2>
                <p>What started as the Society for the Protection and Ethical Treatment of Magical Creatures
                    (S.P.E.T.M.C., bastardized as Spetmac as a mocking reference to Hermione's Spew) under the directive
                    of Hermione Weasley, Ministress for Magic, has now become the Sanctuary, a motley crew of tainted
                    wix, werewolves, and other various sentient creatures who use any means necessary to protect magical
                    creatures. They've taken credit for multiple assassinations of Ministry executioners, and they've
                    made it very clear that they will not stop until all magical creatures are given the freedoms they
                    deserve. The Sanctuary was founded and is led by the militant son of Rubeus Hagrid, Caeruleus
                    Hagrid, who uses brutal tactics along with his dad's old pet hellhound Fluffy as a companion. The
                    Sanctuary consists of three main groups that split into teams of two. The three groups are the
                    werewolves, the wix supporters, and the halfling/tainteds (including but not limited to part-veela
                    and part-giants). The wix are considered hunters/huntresses and usually pair off with a werewolf or
                    a tained as their predator partner. Further, anti-magical creature and tainted legislation has
                    become so strict that the Sanctuary is sometimes forced to take in those who cannot be accepted at
                    schools or the hospital. Therefore, they have their own groups of educators and healers in addition
                    to caretakers the magical creatures taken in for companionship or rehabilitation, thus truly acting
                    like a wildlife sanctuary.</p>

                <p>Once a mercenary group that hunted wizards and witches in the 1700s in the early United States, the
                    Scourers have now extended their operations into the UK amid the political turmoil. Led by the
                    Barebone siblings, they offer their services to the highest bidder. Bishops are cold-blooded
                    assassins who tend to take on high-profile targets. Knights are mercenaries, usually operating in
                    units of two or more to provide offensive support. Rooks are some of the most skilled security
                    agents in the world, doing everything from standing bodyguard for high-profile figureheads to
                    guarding major drug deals if necessary. Pawns, contrary to the connotation of the word, are just as
                    important. They are the spies of the Scourers, paid for their ability to stay quiet and stay hidden
                    in order to acquire as much intelligence as possible.</p>

                <h2>The Department of Magical Order and Peace</h2>
                <p>A sub-branch of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, the DMOP was created in direct response to
                    the magical factional wars occurring on the streets of London almost every day. The DMLE was quickly
                    overrun by its own bureaucracy, so the DMOP was give special privileges to put down any magical
                    group seeking to disrupt the status quo without deliberation or trial. The DMOP is the right of the
                    DMLE Department Head, though DMOP does have its own leader as well that reports to DMLE. Most
                    Inquisitorial Squads consist of one Auror, two Hit Wix, and an executioner an unusually deadly
                    combination when allowed to act on the public without restraint.</p>
